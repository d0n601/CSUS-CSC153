# Lab 1: Forensic Investigation on Your Own Personal Computer
### CSC 153 - Computer Forensics Principles and Practice


## Introduction  
For this lab we're to conduct a forensics investigation on our own PC, using any case management tools we so choose. Options presented to us included [OSForensics](https://www.osforensics.com/), [FTK](https://accessdata.com/products-services/forensic-toolkit-ftk), [Sleuthkit/Autopsy_Browser](https://www.sleuthkit.org/), [Encase](https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic), and [ProDiscover Basic](https://www.prodiscover.com/). I'll be using [Sleuthkit](https://www.sleuthkit.org/) and the [Autopsy](https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/) Browser, because it is **free** and **open source**.


## Data Acquisition  
In preparation for this Lab I've installed [CAIN 10.0](https://www.caine-live.net/) onto a flash drive. The computer I'll be investigating for this lab is my laptop, which has a 256GB hard drive with Ubuntu 16.04 installed. So, the first thing to be done is prepare my evidence drive, which is 500GB, large enough to fit an image of my laptop's entire drive.

I booted my laptop from the flash drive and zeroed out the evidence drive (which took a while).

After that I created an image of my laptop's drive, and verified the hash.



## Investigation


1. Provide screenshots of the following information
    * Number and type of documents (Word, Power Point, Excel, etc).
    * Number of images.
    * Number and types of encrypted files.
    * Number of executable files.
    * Number of deleted files.
    * Size of unallocated space.
    * Top 20 websites visited.

2. Do a search to determine the number of times your name, and typical places your name appeared.


3. Do a search to determine the number of times CSUS or Sac State appeared and typical places where it appeared.

4. Any surprising information you least expected to find.



## Deliverable Instructions
You need to submit a lab report to Canvas. In all cases show the commands used to obtain your results and any screen shots as appropriate. Please include necessary narrative and analysis to make your report clear. The report will be evaluated based on the correctness, completeness, clarity and quality of English writing.
